We will port one until we get an icmp "port
 * unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max (which
 * defaults to 64 hops & can be changed with the -m flag).


 -m number of hops to be sent 
 -q number of probes
 -w timeout 
 -p to change port 

 roundtrip time of each probe 

 Probe packets are UDP format 
 Dont want destination host to process them ,hence it is sent to an unlikely value 





If two hops addresses are same ,then this is due to buggy kernel that forwards packets with zero ttl

 * (I start to see why I'm having so much trouble with mail to
 * MIT.)  Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 & 17 hops away
 * either don't send ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them
 * with a ttl too small to reach us.  14 - 17 are running the
 * MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time exceeded"s.  God
 * only knows what's going on with 12.
 *
 * The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in
 * the 4.[23]BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3)
 * sends an unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the
 * original datagram.  Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is
 * zero, the icmp "time exceeded" is guaranteed to not make it back
 * to us.  The behavior of this bug is slightly more interesting
 * when it appears on the destination system:


! -due to obsolete DEC's Ultrix,Sun 3.x
!H ,!N, !P - got a Host,netwrokr or protocol unreachable
!source route failed
!F-fragementation needed

must be run by root

\\ raw ip socket using proto
 * IPPROTO_RAW must interpret the data sent as an ip datagram (as
 * opposed to data to be wrapped in a ip datagram)

--pid as port
